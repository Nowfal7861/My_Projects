Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

This project aims to detect fake news articles using a supervised machine learning model trained on two datasets: one containing true news and the other containing fake news.



Datasets

This project uses the following datasets (in `.xlsx` format):

- `True.xlsx` — Contains real news articles
- `Fake.xlsx` — Contains fake news articles

Each dataset includes the following columns:
- `title`
- `text`
- `subject`
- `date`



Requirements

Make sure the following libraries are installed:


pip install pandas numpy sklearn matplotlib seaborn nltk openpyxl




Project Overview

1. Load the datasets (True and Fake news)
2. Preprocess the data (remove stopwords, punctuation, and lowercase)
3. Combine both datasets and label them (`1` for True, `0` for Fake)
4. Vectorize the text using `TfidfVectorizer`
5. Train/Test Split
6. Train the model using Logistic Regression
7. Evaluate the model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report



Model Training

The model is trained using `LogisticRegression` from `sklearn`. You can retrain the model with your own dataset by replacing the Excel files and running the notebook again.


Output

The final output includes:

* Model accuracy
* Confusion matrix
* Classification report



Notes

* This project is for educational purposes.
* You can extend it with other models (e.g., SVM, RandomForest, or LSTM).
* The model currently uses basic NLP preprocessing; improvements can be made using advanced techniques (e.g., lemmatization, POS tagging).
