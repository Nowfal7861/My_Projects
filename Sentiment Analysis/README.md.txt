
Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning

This project performs sentiment analysis on text data using machine learning techniques. The goal is to classify text into **positive** or **negative** sentiments.



Dataset

This project uses a dataset (presumably in `.csv` format) which contains:

- `text` — the input sentence or review
- `label` — the sentiment (`1` for positive, `0` for negative)

Note: You can replace the dataset with your own by ensuring it has similar structure.



Requirements

Install the required Python libraries before running:


pip install pandas numpy sklearn matplotlib seaborn nltk




Project Workflow

1. Load the dataset
2. Preprocess the text:

   * Lowercasing
   * Removing punctuation
   * Removing stopwords
   * Tokenization
3. Visualize the distribution of sentiment labels
4. Feature extraction using `TfidfVectorizer`
5. Split the data into training and testing sets
6. Train a machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression)
7. Evaluate the model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report



Model Training

The model is trained using `LogisticRegression` from `scikit-learn`. You can easily replace this with other classifiers like:

* `MultinomialNB`
* `RandomForestClassifier`
* `SVC`



Output

The notebook provides:

* Sentiment distribution plot
* Accuracy of the model
* Confusion matrix
* Precision, recall, and F1-score



Future Improvements

* Use a deep learning model (LSTM, BERT, etc.)
* Add emoji or slang handling during preprocessing
* Train on larger or multi-language datasets
